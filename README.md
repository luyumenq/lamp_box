You can install any incandescent or **DIMMABLE** LED lamp bulbs with E27 socket using the components listed in the project.

You can modify the PCB to add other modules i.e. LDR, microphone, or anything you like!

Generally, rotate the knob to dim the light. Press it down to switch between on and off state. Brightness info will be kept.
